# Things to add
- [ ] use of GitHub actions to automatically build and push Docker image to DockerHub --- it may make it easier to add Docker images to ICA
- [ ] Bring your own S3 bucket ---- point to current Documentation and findings
- [ ] use of the ICA API - python requests + user input
- [ ] programmatic way to submit + monitor jobs --- use Dan Crawford's scripts
- [ ] common ICA commandline utilities/templates
- [ ] logs of interest for troubleshooting
- [ ] pointers to documentation and examples (i.e. GDS and knowing when data is seen by ICA, SNS for automatic email alerts)
- [ ] remote use of workspace --- jupyter notebook
- [ ] pain points in transferring data
- [ ] where to find logs of the ICA connector
